# Bundlem

Hey, thanks for looking into this file. Seems like you gonna fire up your code editor to raise some PRs. But, hold on for a moment, we need to talk.

## Issues
Due to the lack of "human" resources, I may not guarantee if I can work on every other issue (or feature), but the valid and important ones will be surely taken care of.

## Pull requests
Before raising a PR, please raise a relevant issue for that. Once the issue is raised, please wait for it to get approved before you actually start working on it. By doing so we can avoid conflicts and maintain a good work-flow.

## Before you write your React code
- Please use functional components - with Hooks if necessary. *Why?* - Check out here: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
- Please make sure your code is 100% tested. *Why?* - To keep Bundlem robust.
- Please write docstrings (for components or functions) using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/). *Why?* - Well, primarily for common ground, but also check this out: https://medium.com/@antonkrinitsyn/why-use-jsdoc-19d19e40822c

Thank you for patiently going through this. I am eagerly waiting for your contributions. :)
